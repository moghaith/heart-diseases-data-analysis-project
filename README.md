# Heart Disease Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about heart disease patients and develop predictive models for heart disease presence.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from [UCI heart diseases dataset] and contains 303 records with 76 features including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of various features, correlations, and patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Results Interpretation**: Interpreting the results and drawing conclusions from the analysis.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
